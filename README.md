This review covers nearly **400 works** from **the start of the first paper on SSM in remote sensing to October 27, 2025**, encompassing a total of **22** months. We systematically organize the information from two perspectives: the **8** categories of remote sensing tasks (Classification, Segmentation, Object Detection, Change Detection, Super Resolution, Denoising and Dehazing, and Pan-Sharpening) and the **7** methods for RS-SSM structural design (Scanning Strategies, High-level Framework, Hybrid Architecture Design, and Fundamental Component Refinement, etc). Within each subcategory, we further classify the works in **finer detail and analyze various design ideas, techniques, advantages, and disadvantages**. Our paper is currently **under revision for SCIS**, and since arXiv does not accept papers that have not yet completed the review process, we will update **all content** on GitHub and publicly share the **paper and process records** after the paper is accepted.

### Preliminary of SSM

> The State Space Model is a mathematical model of a physical system that uses state variables to describe how inputs influence the system’s behavior over time, typically through first-order differential or difference equations. [Originating in the 1950s](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396), this approach was applied in fields such as control engineering and system identification. **SSM** comprises two key equations: (1) the **state equation**, which defines the relationship between inputs and previous states through matrix operations, and (2) the **output equation**, which determines how the state matrix is transformed into observable outputs:

### SSMs for Sequential Modeling
>With the rapid advancement of large-scale sequence models and the substantial increase in data volume, developing sequence models that outperform Transformers in efficiency has emerged as a critical challenge. **SSMs** inherently possess advantages over Transformers in this regard, making them a compelling choice for sequential modeling. In Transformers, the self-attention mechanism results in computational complexity that scales quadratically with the number of tokens, making it challenging to adapt to long-sequence modeling or prediction tasks. In contrast, **SSMs** benefit from state and output equations that can be interwoven in a manner that mathematically unfolds into a structure akin to one-dimensional convolution operations, resulting in **linear complexity**. Therefore, in August 2022, Gu *et al.* introduced SSMs to sequence processing tasks and developed [the **S4** model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11893) to address the inherent computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The S4 model introduces a memory mechanism that incorporates time steps and [the **HiPPO** framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07669), allowing it to compress all currently observed input signals into a coefficient vector. The discretized SSM can be described in the following form:

>At the same time, when SSM is stacked in multiple layers, it can be represented in a form similar to one-dimensional convolution, thereby achieving fast inference:

### SSMs for Vision (Vision-Mamba)

> Early SSMs did not perform as well as self-attention mechanisms in key modalities such as language. Therefore, in December 2023, Gu *et al.* introduced two key improvements by proposing the **structured SSM (S6)**, also known as [**Mamba**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752). At the model level, SSM parameters are designed to be functions of the input, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information throughout the sequence. At the hardware level, a hardware-aware algorithm aims to minimize I/O access, thereby achieving further acceleration. In language modeling, S6 achieves an inference speed five times faster than Transformers, while matching the accuracy of Transformers that are twice its size.

> In the realm of vision tasks—where images are highly position-sensitive and require comprehensive global context—SSMs have garnered widespread attention for their ability to model long-sequence dependencies with linear complexity. As a result, in January 2024, Zhu *et al.* introduced SSMs into computer vision and developed [**Vision Mamba**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09417). The structure of Vision Mamba is similar to that of Vision Transformer, while the self-attention blocks are replaced with Mamba blocks. Liu *et al.* proposed [**VMamba**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10166) during the same period, which introduced **2D-selective scanning**. This implementation features various scanning techniques through the **2D Selective Scan (SS2D)** block, integrating them with internal **Visual State-Space (VSS)** blocks. The design of the model structure and scanning strategy for Vision Mamba and VMamba provides insights for subsequent research.
